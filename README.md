# `.dotfiles`

My dotfiles for NixOS Hyprland preconfigured stack.

I can't wait to add more stuff but sleep is pretty important.

## Instructions

TODO write this.

### Hardware config

You should check if hardware config has been generated.

```sh

```

### Build

Literally just build

```sh
nixos-rebuild --flake ~/.dotfiles
```
